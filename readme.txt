This is a Unix-like OS called 'ThreadOS', written in Java.  Tests with the following numbers in them indicate tests which test the functionality of that number's corresponding feature:

1 - shell
2 - scheduler
3 - sychronizer
4 - disk cache
5 - file system

example of how to execute one of the tests:

$ java boot
    threadOS ver 1.0:
    Type ? for help
    threadOS: a new thread (thread=Thread[Thread-3,2,main] tid=0 pid=-1)
    -->l Test2b
